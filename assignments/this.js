/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding is when "this" keyword refers to the window Object.
* 2. Implicit Binding is when "this" keyword refers to the object before the dot in that function call.
* 3. New Binding is when "this" kw refers to the Object created by calling the constructor function with "new" kw.
* 4. Explicit Binding is when "this" kw is explicitly defined while using call or apply method.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
